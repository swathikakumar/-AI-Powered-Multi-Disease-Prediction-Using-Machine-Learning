# -AI-Powered-Multi-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
In this project, we develop an AI-powered healthcare prediction system using Python and Machine Learning, along with an interactive web-based interface. The system predicts the likelihood of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease based on medical input parameters.
What is a Multi Disease Prediction System?

A Multi Disease Prediction System is an intelligent mechanism that analyzes patient medical data and predicts the risk of multiple diseases.
Based on the data provided by the user, the system delivers instant predictions, helping in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare decision-making.
